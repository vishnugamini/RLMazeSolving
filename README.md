# Maze Solver using Q-Learning

This Python script implements a maze solver using a hybrid Q-Learning algorithm. It allows an agent to navigate through a maze environment and learn an optimal policy to reach the goal efficiently.

## Getting Started

To run the maze solver script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the script using the command:

## Usage

1. **Enter Maze Configuration:** You will be prompted to enter the size of the maze and the maze configuration. The maze configuration should consist of 0s (empty spaces) and 1s (obstacles).
2. **Training:** The script will train the maze-solving agent using Q-Learning over a specified number of episodes.
3. **Enter Starting and Goal Positions:** After training, enter the starting position and goal position in the maze.
4. **Visualization:** The script will visualize the maze solving process, showing the path taken by the agent.
5. **Performance Metrics:** The script generates plots showing the accuracy, loss, reward, and exploration rate curves during training.
